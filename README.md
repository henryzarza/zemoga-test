Hi ðŸ‘‹, I generated this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Sadly, I didnâ€™t have time to do the test, the application it was so long

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Know issues

I didn't have time to solve these problems ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜©

- When you click in the link of `Join us now!` in the modal of Log In, the modal should close but it doesn't happen.
- I have a problem with the custom validation in the field of `Password repeat` in SignUp screen, it seems the problem is with `react-hook-form` library.
- The navbar in responsive it doesn't visible, I wanted to do something like menu hamburger but again I didn't have enough time.
- The design of `Log In` and `Sign Up` screens are diferrent to the original design, I didn't have time to do it equal but I didn't want to lose the opportunity to show a small interaction with forms ðŸ¤“
